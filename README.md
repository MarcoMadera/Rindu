## **About the project**

Built with ReactJs/NextJs. It started as a simple script to clean spotify playlists. It served as a way to clean my playlists and to learn how to use the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

It has been taking shape similar to what a clone of Spotify is. It is intended to add features such as creating dynamic playlists, advanced search, and background noises.
