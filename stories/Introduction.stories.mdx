# Welcome to Rindu Component Library

Here you can find a list of all the components that are used in Rindu [Github Repository](https://github.com/MarcoMadera/spotify-playlists-cleaner)

View their code in the `stories` directory to learn how they work.

Some of the components in the Rindu Component Library require an access token to function properly. To obtain an access token, you can follow these steps:

- Go to the [Spotify API Console](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user) in a new browser tab.
- Log in to your Spotify account if prompted.
- Click the "Get Token" button and select the scopes user-read-playback-state and user-modify-playback-state.
- Click "Request Token" to generate a new access token.
- Copy the access token to your clipboard.

To use the components that require an access token, you can paste the token into the accessToken input in the "Knobs" section of the component's story. Make sure to click the corresponding button to apply the token. You can find more information about each component's usage in its respective story file in the stories directory.

Happy browsing!
